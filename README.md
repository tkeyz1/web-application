# Web Application  
**CTF Challenge on Web Authentication Penetration Testing**  

---


## **Overview**  

This project focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web-based login and authentication mechanisms. It simulates real-world scenarios where attackers target insecure implementations or weak configurations in authentication systems.  

---

## **Key Concepts Involved**  

- **Credential Brute Forcing:**
  Systematic testing of username-password combinations using tools like Hydra or Burp Suite. 

- **Session Hijacking:**  
  Stealing or manipulating session cookies to impersonate an authenticated user.  

- **Exploitation of Weak Password Policies:**  
  Identifying accounts with default, weak, or reused passwords.  

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass:**  
  Exploiting insecure 2FA implementations, such as predictable OTPs or replaying intercepted codes.  

- **Insecure API Authentication:**  
  Exploiting API endpoints that fail to properly validate tokens or credentials.  

---

## **Project Objectives**  

The main goals are to:  
- Bypass or exploit a web application's authentication mechanism.  
- Gain unauthorized access or retrieve sensitive data, such as user credentials or a hidden "flag" stored in restricted areas.  

---

## **Tools Used**  

- **Burp Suite:** For intercepting and manipulating HTTP/HTTPS traffic.  
- **SQLMap:** To automate SQL injection testing.  
- **OWASP ZAP:** For web vulnerability scanning.  
- **Hydra:** To brute force login credentials.  
- **Postman:** For testing and exploiting API authentication.

## **Typical Steps in the Challenge**  

1. **Reconnaissance:**  
   Analyze the login page, input fields, and the web applicationâ€™s source code (e.g., HTML/JS) for clues like hidden fields or hardcoded credentials.  

2. **Testing Input Validation:**  
   Enter malformed inputs to check how the server processes the data (e.g., testing for SQL injection).  

3. **Bypassing Authentication:**  
   Exploit vulnerabilities like SQLi, session fixation, or misconfigured access controls.  

4. **Retrieving the Flag:**  
   Access restricted areas or sensitive data where the "flag" is hidden, typically stored in text files or within database entries.

## **Benefits of This Project**  

- **Hands-On Experience:**  
  Gain practical skills in identifying and exploiting web authentication vulnerabilities.  

- **Skill Development:**  
  Enhance understanding of secure coding practices and vulnerability mitigation.  

- **Awareness:**  
  Learn to think like an attacker, which helps in designing more secure systems.
