# Web Application Penetration Testing 


**CTF Challenge on Web Authentication Penetration Testing**  

---


## **Overview**  

This project focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web-based login and authentication mechanisms. It simulates real-world scenarios where attackers target insecure implementations or weak configurations in authentication systems.  

---

## **Key Concepts Involved**  

- **Credential Brute Forcing:**
  Systematic testing of username-password combinations using tools like Hydra or Burp Suite. 

- **Session Hijacking:**  
  Stealing or manipulating session cookies to impersonate an authenticated user.  

- **Exploitation of Weak Password Policies:**  
  Identifying accounts with default, weak, or reused passwords.  

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass:**  
  Exploiting insecure 2FA implementations, such as predictable OTPs or replaying intercepted codes.  

- **Insecure API Authentication:**  
  Exploiting API endpoints that fail to properly validate tokens or credentials.  

---

## **Project Objectives**  

The main goals are to:  
- Bypass or exploit a web application's authentication mechanism.  
- Gain unauthorized access or retrieve sensitive data, such as user credentials or a hidden "flag" stored in restricted areas.  

---

### Skills Learned
### 1. Understanding HTTP POST Authentication
- Grasp how login credentials and authentication data are transmitted securely or insecurely using POST requests.
- Learn the structure of POST requests and how form data is encoded and sent to the server.

### 2. Intercepting and Modifying POST Requests
- Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or browser developer tools to capture and modify POST data.
- Practice tampering with parameters such as username, password, tokens, or hidden fields.

### 3. Identifying Vulnerabilities in Authentication
- Detect weak session management and insecure cookie handling.
- Recognize improper input validation leading to injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection).
- Spot logic flaws in authentication workflows (e.g., bypassing login, privilege escalation).

### 4. Exploiting Authentication Flaws
- Perform brute force or credential stuffing attacks on login forms.
- Exploit SQL injection or command injection vulnerabilities in POST parameters.
- Bypass authentication using parameter manipulation or replay attacks.

### 5. Understanding Session and Token Management
- Analyze how sessions and tokens are created, stored, and validated post-authentication.
- Learn to hijack or forge session tokens if vulnerabilities exist.


## **Tools Used**  

- **Burp Suite:** For intercepting and manipulating HTTP/HTTPS traffic.  
- **SQLMap:** To automate SQL injection testing.  
- **OWASP ZAP:** For web vulnerability scanning.  
- **Hydra:** To brute force login credentials.  
- **Postman:** For testing and exploiting API authentication.

## **Typical Steps in the Challenge**  

1. **Reconnaissance:**  
   Analyze the login page, input fields, and the web applicationâ€™s source code (e.g., HTML/JS) for clues like hidden fields or hardcoded credentials.

3. **Testing Input Validation:**  

   Enter malformed inputs to check how the server processes the data (e.g., testing for SQL injection).  

4. **Bypassing Authentication:**  
   Exploit vulnerabilities like SQLi, session fixation, or misconfigured access controls.  

5. **Retrieving the Flag:**  
   Access restricted areas or sensitive data where the "flag" is hidden, typically stored in text files or within database entries.
