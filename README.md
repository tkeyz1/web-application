CTF Challenge on Web Authentication Penetration Testing.  

**Overview**

                                                                    
This project focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web-based login and authentication mechanisms. It is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where insecure implementations or weak configurations in authentication systems are targeted by attackers.



**Key Concepts Involved:**




**Credential Brute Forcing:**
Systematic testing of username-password combinations using tools like Hydra or Burp Suite.

**SQL Injection (SQLi):**
Exploiting input fields in login forms to inject malicious SQL queries that bypass authentication (e.g., admin' OR '1'='1).

**Session Hijacking:**
Stealing or manipulating session cookies to impersonate an authenticated user.

**Exploitation of Weak Password Policies:**
Identifying accounts with default, weak, or reused passwords.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass:**
Exploiting insecure 2FA implementations, such as predictable OTPs or replaying intercepted codes.

**Insecure API Authentication:**
Exploiting API endpoints that fail to properly validate tokens or credentials.




**Project Objectives**


The main goal is to bypass or exploit a web application's authentication mechanism to gain unauthorized access or retrieve sensitive data, such as user credentials or a hidden "flag" stored in restricted areas.


**Tools  Used**

**1.Burp Suite:** For intercepting and manipulating HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

**2.SQLMap:** To automate SQL injection testing.

**3.OWASP ZAP:** For web vulnerability scanning.

**4.Hydra:** To brute force login credentials.

**5.Postman:** For testing and exploiting API authentication.

**Insecure API Authentication:**
Exploiting API endpoints that fail to properly validate tokens or credentials.

**Typical Steps in the Challenge**


**Reconnaissance:**
Analyze the login page, input fields, and the web applicationâ€™s source code (e.g., HTML/JS) for clues like hidden fields or hardcoded credentials.


**Testing Input Validation:**
Enter malformed inputs to check how the server processes the data (e.g., testing for SQL injection).


**Bypassing Authentication:**
Exploit vulnerabilities like SQLi, session fixation, or misconfigured access controls.

**Retrieving the Flag:**
Access restricted areas or sensitive data where the "flag" is hidden, typically stored in text files or within database entries.


**Benefits Of This Project:**


**Hands-On Experience:**
Gain practical skills in identifying and exploiting web authentication vulnerabilities.


**Skill Development:**
Enhance understanding of secure coding practices and vulnerability mitigation.


**Awareness:**
Learn to think like an attacker, which helps in designing more secure systems.
